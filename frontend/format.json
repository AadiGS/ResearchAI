  "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into advanced deep learning architectures for improving natural language understanding capabilities in modern large language models. We propose a novel transformer-based framework that integrates attention mechanisms with contextual embeddings to achieve superior performance in semantic comprehension tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models across multiple benchmarks, including question answering, sentiment analysis, and text classification. The proposed methodology addresses key challenges in handling ambiguous contexts and maintaining coherence in long-form text generation. Through extensive ablation studies, we identify critical components that contribute to the model's enhanced performance and provide insights into the trade-offs between computational efficiency and accuracy. Our findings suggest that the integration of multi-head attention with adaptive learning rates can substantially improve the model's ability to capture nuanced linguistic patterns and contextual dependencies.",
