# Two-Step Journal Search - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### New Function: `find_top_journals(search_query, email)`

A sophisticated two-step journal discovery strategy that finds the most prestigious and relevant journals for your research topic.

---

## üîÑ How It Works (Technical Flow)

### **Step 1: Discover Top Research (Works API)**
```python
GET /works?search=query&per_page=30&sort=cited_by_count:desc
```
- Fetches 30 most-cited papers matching the search query
- Filters for journal publications only
- Sorts by citation count (finds influential research)

### **Step 2: Aggregate Journals (Sources API)**
```python
GET /sources?filter=ids.openalex:ID1|ID2|ID3
```
- Extracts unique journal IDs from the 30 papers
- Counts how many times each journal appeared (relevance)
- Fetches complete journal metadata
- Calculates comprehensive score for each journal
- Returns top 3 highest-scoring journals

---

## üìä Scoring Algorithm (0-100 Points)

### **1. Relevance Score (40 points)**
- **What:** How many times the journal appeared in top 30 papers
- **Why:** If top research is published there, it's a good venue
- **Formula:** `min(appearances / 10, 1.0) √ó 40`
- **Example:** 6 appearances ‚Üí 24 points

### **2. h-index Score (30 points)**
- **What:** Journal's h-index (bibliometric impact measure)
- **Why:** Indicates long-term influence and quality
- **Formula:** `min(h_index / 200, 1.0) √ó 30`
- **Example:** h-index of 500 ‚Üí 30 points (capped)

### **3. Citation Count Score (20 points)**
- **What:** Total citations received by all journal publications
- **Why:** Shows overall impact and readership
- **Formula:** `min(citations / 100000, 1.0) √ó 20`
- **Example:** 1.7M citations ‚Üí 20 points (capped)

### **4. Open Access Bonus (10 points)**
- **What:** Whether journal supports open access publishing
- **Why:** Increases visibility and accessibility
- **Calculation:** Is OA or in DOAJ? ‚Üí +10 points

## üÜö Comparison: Old vs New Method

| Feature | Original Method | Two-Step Method |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Searches For** | Individual papers | Journals (venues) |
| **API Calls** | 1 (/works only) | 2 (/works + /sources) |
| **Ranking Basis** | Paper keywords + recency | Journal prestige + relevance |
| **Output** | Top 3 papers | Top 3 journals |
| **Best Use Case** | Finding specific papers | Finding publication venues |
| **Scoring Focus** | 60% keywords, 25% recency | 40% relevance, 30% h-index |

## üí° Key Insights from Results

### Why Nature and IEEE TPAMI Tied at 74?
- Both appeared 6 times in top 30 papers (high relevance)
- Both have exceptional h-index and citations (maxed out those scores)
- Neither is open access (0 bonus points)
- Difference is in specific metrics, but total comes to same score

### Why Neural Networks Scored Lower?
- Only appeared 2 times (lower relevance ‚Üí 8 points vs 24)
- Still has great h-index and citations (got full points there)
- Missing those 16 relevance points dropped total to 58
